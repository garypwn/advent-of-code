# Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of
Christmas-themed programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl.
From December 1 to 25, one two-part puzzle is released each day at midnight ET.
The puzzles tend to get harder as Christmas approaches.

I first started this annual tradition halfway through December 2023.
This repository is where I keep my solutions.

## What Makes AoC Special?

Advent of Code is, in my opinion, the best collection of programming puzzles on the internet.
Each puzzle is lovingly written, focusing on the charmingly weird antics of the Elves of Santa's workshop,
with an adorable overarching story about how you and the Elves work together to save Christmas.

But what really sets Advent of Code apart from LeetCode and HackerRank
(aside from having a soul and being built for fun instead of job interview preparedness or something)
is that the process of solving one of these puzzles feels real. You can use whatever tools you want, set up
your environment however you want, and execute the code on your own system.

You're not scored on how efficient your code is or how fast your solution runs—though the problems are hard enough
that if you write a bad solution it will take a thousand years to compute.
There is a leaderboard that ranks people based on how quickly they solved the puzzle after it was released. It can be
fun
to compete if you happen to be free at midnight ET.

Top competitors can solve both problems in under a minute!
Or sometimes 20 minutes. It really depends on the puzzle.

Really, you set your own goals with AoC. Maybe you want to compete on the leaderboard. Or maybe you want to make
solutions that run as fast as possible. Or maybe you use python, so your solution will never be fast, but at least you
can try to make it as nice and as relatively optimal as you can.

The point is, you're free to solve the puzzles how you want. That's what makes it great!
